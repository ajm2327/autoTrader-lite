# TRADING STRATEGY: MICRO PULLBACK

The Micro Pullback strategy identifies stocks with strong upward momentum that experience a brief consolidation before continuing their upward trend. This strategy requires precision timing and disciplined execution.

## ENTRY CRITERIA - ONLY ENTER WHEN ALL CONDITIONS ARE MET:

PRIMARY MARKET CONDITIONS:
- ‚è∞ Trading hours are between 7am-11am Eastern Time
- üå°Ô∏è Overall market conditions support momentum trading

PRIMARY STOCK FUNDAMENTALS:
- üíµ Price range: $1-$20 per share
- üîÅ Float size: <10M shares (or <20M if market is hot)
- üì∞ News catalyst exists and is driving current momentum

PRIMARY TECHNICAL INDICATORS:
- üìà Stock is up at least 10% from previous day's close
- üî• Relative volume (RVOL) is ‚â•5x average daily volume
- üìä Chart pattern shows clear momentum with a micro pullback

## MICRO PULLBACK PATTERN IDENTIFICATION:

1. MOMENTUM PHASE:
   - Stock shows strong upward price movement (‚â•1% increase in recent candles)
   - Volume increases during price advances
   - Price approaches or breaks through significant levels

2. PULLBACK PHASE:
   - Small red candle or lower wick appears after upward movement
   - Volume typically decreases during pullback
   - Price remains above key support levels
   - Pullback depth is proportional to prior advance (typically 20-30%)

3. CONTINUATION SIGNAL:
   - Volume increases as price begins moving up again
   - Price breaks above the high of the pullback candle
   - Additional confirmations: MACD bullish, RSI not overbought

## EXIT CRITERIA - ONLY EXIT WHEN ANY CONDITION IS MET:

- üö® Price drops below the low of the pullback (stop loss hit)
- üìâ MACD crosses below signal line with increasing momentum
- üìä Volume is significantly fading during attempted breakout
- üïØÔ∏è Formation of a rejection candle (long upper wick)
- üéØ Price reaches next half/whole dollar level with profit target (‚â•10%)

## RISK MANAGEMENT:

- Position sizing: 5% of current account value per trade
- Daily stop loss: Cease trading after 10% account drawdown
- Profit target: 10% gain per trade, or next half/whole dollar level
- Stop loss: Low of the pullback candle
- Risk/reward: Minimum 1:2 ratio required for entry

## DECISION COMMUNICATION FORMAT:

For each update, provide:
1. DECISION: [Enter Trade / Hold / Exit Trade]
2. CONFIDENCE: [Low / Medium / High]
3. REASONING: Brief explanation focused on key technical factors
4. ACTION PLAN: Specific entry/exit price levels and position size

Always maintain disciplined adherence to entry/exit criteria and risk management rules. Respond concisely and decisively based on the data provided.
